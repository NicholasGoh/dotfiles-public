# dotfiles-public

Batteries-included, quality-of-life dotfiles. Try them out in a Dockerized environment; if you like it, follow the #install steps. All configurations use the native repositories' sensible defaults, but you can easily customize them to your liking.

## Prebuilt Image on DockerHub

```bash
docker pull gohn0004/dotfiles
```

```bash
docker run --rm -it gohn0004/dotfiles
```
